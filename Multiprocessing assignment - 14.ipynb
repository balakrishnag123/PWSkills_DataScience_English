    "Ans - Multiprocessing is the ability of the system to run one or more processes in parallel. In simple words, multiprocessing uses the two or more CPU within the single computer system. This method is also capable to allocate the tasks between more than one process.Processing units share the main memory and peripherals to process programs simultaneously. Multiprocessing Application breaks into smaller parts and runs independently. Each process is allocated to the processor by the operating system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why it is useful:\n",
    "Multiprocessing is essential to perform the multiple tasks within the Computer system. Suppose a computer without multiprocessing or single processor. We assign various processes to that system at the same time.It will then have to interrupt the previous task and move to another to keep all processes going. It is as simple as a chef is working alone in the kitchen. He has to do several tasks to cook food such as cutting, cleaning, cooking, kneading dough, baking, etc.Therefore, multiprocessing is essential to perform several task at the same time without interruption. It also makes easy to track all the tasks. That is why the concept of multiprocessing is to arise."
